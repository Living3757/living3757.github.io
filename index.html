                    <p>Hello, my name is Living, and I am a web developer trying to land a job at google. <br/> I also like game development but I am currently focusing on web development to get a job first and then learn game development as a side topic to focus on when I have nothing else to do.</p>
                    <p>I also like playing games. My favourite games are Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Halo:  The Master Chief Collection. I also love Star-Wars. My favourite Star-Wars characters are: Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth-Vader, and Luke Skywalker. <br/>
                         I like Yoda because hes a god. I like Obi-Wan Kenobi because he's cool and the memes are funny. Also the Kenobi show is amazing. I like Darth-Vader because he is powerful, and he looks really cool, and I like Luke Skywalker because hes the main character of the Skywalker Saga which is my favourite series. <br/>
                          Han Solo is also the best character in my opinion. He is the best pilot 100%.</p>
                    <p>I am from Canada but my background is Vietnamese. My favourite podcast is Scrubs by Ryan because he tells stories about crazy and insane stupid people which I find entertaining. My favourite song is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaDKuFfkSMI">Take care - George</a> <br/>
                     I also am a speedcuber. A speedcuber is someone who solves twisty puzzles fast. A very popular twisty puzzle for cubers is the Rubik's Cube. My record is 14.66 seconds. I have been a speedcuber for 3 years. <br/>
                     My favourite web-browser is Firefox. I like it because it is secure, doesn't use bing, and it uses google.com as a default. It also just looks very nice, smooth, and clean. More details about me in the <a href="https://linktr.ee/socialpageliving">About</a> section.</p>
