              Hey! Welcome to my Home page. This is where I will tell you may things about me and getting myself a place on the internet!
              <br> <br>
              1. About Me: <br>
              <br>
              My online name is Living, and I would like to keep my first name and last name private. I am a student web developer that wants to get a job at Google as a software engineer
              and I enjoy web devopment. I used to do Unity game development but I shortly quit due to I realize how hard it is to learn and web development was something I actually enjoyed while Unity game development felt like a chore.
              I also enjoy video-games a lot. My favourite video-games are GTA V, GTA San Andreas, CS-GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive), Star-Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Minecraft. <br>
              <br>
              2. My Likes: <br>
              <br>
              I like fantasy a lot. Star-Wars is my favourite show ever. My favourite Star-Wars comic is "Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 1" because Darth Vader is one of my favourites but Obi-Wan Kenobi is my favourite because I think he is cool.
              My favourite characters are Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, Yoda, and Han Solo. I prefer Obi-Wan Kenobi more than Darth Vader because since Darth Vader lost his limbs, it's easy to take his prosthetics apart with the force as shown in "Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith Vol. 1". <br>
              <br>
              3. My dislikes: <br>
              <br>
              This one won't be very long, but I don't like loud people. I find them really obnoxious and just annoying. Somehow I'm still friends with a few. I also don't like pineapple <i>NOT</i> on pizza. I don't know why people would say it doesn't belong on pizza. I also don't like any holiday besides Christmas. It's not that I hate them, I just don't like or hate them.
              I don't like chocolate either. Chocolate just makes me feel disgusted when I eat it. The only chocolate I can bare to eat is Kit-Kat. That's all my dislikes. <br>
              <br>
              To Conclude: <br>
              <br>
              To conlude this page, I would like to promote Fro-Games which is a team that I work at as a web developer. Fro-Games is a game development team that works on game in Lua and are currently working on a project called Beneath. Beneath is a horror game that will be released for free and you can visit the Fro-Games website here: <a href="https://frogameswebholder.github.io">Fro Games</a>
